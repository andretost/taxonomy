      The document analyzes the potential impact of Donald Trump's presidency on
      the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on economic and strategic implications.
      Trump's proposed "universal tariffs" are expected to reduce demand for
      Asia-Pacific exports, weaken regional currencies, and accelerate the
      realignment of global supply chains. Strategic competition between the US
      and China is likely to intensify, with a focus on trade practices,
      industrial policies, national security, and international diplomacy.
      Multiple Asia-Pacific countries may face higher US tariffs, reduced US
      commitments for climate finance, and potential reductions in security
      guarantees. The realignment of global supply chains within and outside the
      Asia-Pacific region is expected to intensify, and US monetary policy is
      likely to remain tighter for longer, with a stronger US dollar.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are the key economic impacts of Trump's proposed "universal
          tariffs" on the Asia-Pacific region?
        answer: >-
          Trump's proposed "universal tariffs" are likely to reduce demand for
          Asia-Pacific merchandise exports, weaken the region's currencies
          versus the US dollar, and accelerate the realignment of global supply
          chains.
      - question: >-
          How is the strategic competition between the US and China expected to
          evolve under Trump's presidency?
        answer: >-
          Strategic competition between the US and China is very likely to
          intensify, with a focus on trade practices, industrial policies,
          national security interests, and international diplomacy. Both
          countries are likely to deepen "de-risking" initiatives in strategic
          industries and supply chains, citing national security concerns.
      - question: >-
          What are the potential implications for US security cooperation with
          Asia-Pacific countries under Trump's administration?
        answer: >-
          While US security cooperation will likely continue via the Quad and
          AUKUS, Asia-Pacific countries may face more restricted security
          guarantees from the US. However, the US will likely continue to
          provide arms shipments to Taiwan and diplomatically oppose Chinese
          claims in the South China Sea, albeit with some reluctance to support
          Philippine claims militarily.

      The document "Big Picture 2025  Dealing with consequences" discusses the
      challenges and strategies for supply chains in 2025, highlighting
      geopolitical rivalries, protectionism, climate change, and the need for
      resilience and cost control. It predicts that 2025 will be a year of
      policy implementation, with protectionism remaining a key issue in the US
      and EU, and China potentially taking more active measures. The report
      suggests that companies can manage risks by diversifying supply origins,
      investing in technology for agility, and multi-sourcing. It also notes
      potential controversies in logistics investments and the impact of
      additive manufacturing on economic development.

      Heightened risk of armed confrontations in public places across Monterrey
      metro area

      Risk analysis: Armed confrontations between rival criminals or between
      criminals and security forces in public places, including motorways, are
      likely over the next few weeks. The risk has been heightened after
      “narco-banners” appeared in the municipalities of Juárez, Guadalupe and
      Santa Catarina, part of the Monterrey metro area, Nuevo León state. The
      banners were signed by the Northeastern Cartel (Cartel del Noreste [CDN])
      and contained threatening messages against the Sinaloa, Jalisco and Gulf
      cartels. During the first half of the year, the Monterrey metro area
      recorded a 37% year-over-year increase in the number of murders, a trend
      likely related to intensifying turf wars between these cartels. Although
      most armed confrontations tend to occur away from business and leisure
      areas in the city, assassination attempts occasionally take place in
      shopping centers or restaurants, increasing the risks of collateral injury
      or death for bystanders.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What is the primary risk highlighted in the document for the Monterrey
          metro area?
        answer: >-
          The primary risk highlighted is the heightened possibility of armed
          confrontations between rival criminals or between criminals and
          security forces in public places, including motorways, over the next
          few weeks.
      - question: >-
          What specific event has increased the risk of armed confrontations in
          the Monterrey metro area?
        answer: >-
          The appearance of "narco-banners" signed by the Northeastern Cartel
          (Cartel del Noreste [CDN]) in the municipalities of Juárez, Guadalupe,
          and Santa Catarina, which contained threatening messages against the
          Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Gulf cartels, has increased the risk of armed
          confrontations.
      - question: >-
          What trend has been observed in the Monterrey metro area regarding
          murders, and what is it likely related to?
        answer: >-
          The Monterrey metro area has recorded a 37% year-over-year increase in
          the number of murders during the first half of the year. This trend is
          likely related to intensifying turf wars between the cartels.

      The European Parliament has approved the new European Commission, led by
      Ursula von der Leyen, which will focus on key areas such as US trade
      relations, defense, competitiveness, and environmental policy. The
      Commission aims to mitigate the threat of US tariffs through pre-emptive
      deals, enhance defense collaboration, and improve EU competitiveness.
      However, budgetary limitations and political pressures may lead to
      trade-offs between green initiatives and competitiveness, potentially
      diluting elements of the European Green Deal.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are the main priorities for the new European Commission led by
          Ursula von der Leyen?
        answer: >-
          The main priorities include mitigating the threat of US tariffs,
          enhancing defense collaboration, improving EU competitiveness, and
          focusing on environmental policy.
      - question: How does the new Commission plan to address the threat of US tariffs?
        answer: >-
          The Commission is likely to seek a pre-emptive deal with the incoming
          US administration to avoid across-the-board tariffs, potentially
          offering concessions such as buying more LNG from the US and aligning
          the EU’s China policy with that of the US.
      - question: >-
          What challenges does the Commission face in implementing the European
          Green Deal?
        answer: >-
          The Commission faces budgetary limitations and political pressures,
          with some member states and parties prioritizing industrial
          competitiveness over climate targets. This may lead to the dilution of
          major elements of the European Green Deal, including the EU Taxonomy,
          the Corporate Sustainability Directive (CSD), and the Corporate
          Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

      The document discusses the upcoming vote on imposing permanent duties on
      Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) by the Council of the European Union,
      which coincides with the release of the "Future of European
      Competitiveness" report authored by Mario Draghi. The report, commissioned
      by the European Commission, advocates for policies to enhance the EU's
      global competitiveness, including increasing public and private investment
      by €800 billion annually, focusing on innovation, green technologies, and
      securing supply chains. The report also suggests creating EU corporate
      champions and issuing more common debt. However, the EU's industrial
      sector faces structural barriers, such as high energy costs and
      competition from China's expanding industrial sector. The proposed tariffs
      on Chinese EVs have divided EU member states, with some supporting
      protectionist measures and others concerned about potential retaliation
      from China. The report's funding proposals may face opposition from member
      states like Germany and the Netherlands, and significant reforms might
      only occur after a major economic disruption.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What is the main focus of the "Future of European Competitiveness"
          report authored by Mario Draghi?
        answer: >-
          The report focuses on advocating policies to make the EU more
          competitive globally, including increasing public and private
          investment by €800 billion per year, emphasizing innovation, green
          technologies, and securing supply chains. It also suggests creating EU
          corporate champions and issuing more common debt.
      - question: >-
          What are the structural barriers hindering the growth of the EU's
          industrial sector?
        answer: >-
          The EU's industrial sector is hindered by high energy costs, which
          increase operational costs and make it difficult for EU producers to
          compete with regions like the US and China. Additionally, China's
          expanding industrial sector, with its focus on high-value-added
          exports, poses a significant challenge to EU competitiveness.
      - question: >-
          What are the differing views among EU member states regarding the
          proposed tariffs on Chinese EVs?
        answer: >-
          France and Italy support the tariffs to protect their industries from
          subsidized Chinese EVs, while Germany and Spain are more cautious.
          German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez
          have expressed concerns about potential retaliatory measures from
          China that could harm their respective automotive sectors.
