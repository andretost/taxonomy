### US presidential election outcome: Impact on Asia-Pacific 

 In Asia-Pacific, US President-elect Donald Trump is very likely to make significant changes to bilateral relations. Trump’s proposed “universal tariffs” will also likely reduce demand for Asia-Pacific merchandise exports, weaken the region’s currencies versus the US dollar, and accelerate the realignment of global supply chains. Key findings Strategic competition between the US and mainland China is very likely to intensify, with focus on trade practices, industrial policies, national security interests and international diplomacy. Multiple Asia-Pacific countries are likely to face higher US tariffs on trade, reduced US commitments for climate finance and potential reduction in security guarantees from the US, although US security cooperation will likely continue via the Quad and AUKUS. Realignment of global supply chains, both within the Asia-Pacific region and between Asia and other zones, is likely to intensify, primarily in response to Trump’s planned tariff increases on mainland China. Under Trump’s tariff and tax policies, US monetary policy is likely to remain tighter for longer while the US dollar is likely to strengthen, implying an increased risk of depreciation for many Asia-Pacific currencies, in turn increasing the cost of imported energy and other commodities priced in dollars.

Unlike outgoing President Joe Biden’s efforts to increase broad US economic and diplomatic engagement with strategic partners in Asia-Pacific, Trump’s foreign policy focus will be more transactional, seeking “better deals” from partner countries. Multiple Asia-Pacific countries are very likely to face higher US tariffs on trade and reduced US commitments for climate finance. While US security cooperation will likely continue via Quad and AUKUS, Asia-Pacific countries will nevertheless face more restricted security guarantees from the US. Strategic competition between the US and mainland China will very likely intensify, with focus on trade practices, industrial policies, national security interests and international diplomacy. As complete decoupling is impractical for either the US and mainland China, both are likely to deepen “de-risking” initiatives focused on “strategic” industries and supply chains, citing national security concerns. Competing strategic interests in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait will continue to strain bilateral ties. Mainland China will almost certainly seek in parallel to further expand its economic and diplomatic influence with emerging market countries through platforms such as the BRICS and the Belt and Road Initiative, especially if Trump prefers to deprioritize and/or exit multilateral frameworks such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government is almost certain to proactively engage with the Trump administration, while seeking to secure carveouts for Taiwan-based manufacturers and exports in response to tariff increases by the Trump administration. The Lai government is also likely to expedite planned military reforms and increases to Taiwan’s defense budget in anticipation of a decreased likelihood of direct US military intervention under Trump in the event of escalation between Taiwan and mainland China; however, these efforts will be limited by the opposition-controlled legislature. Given strong bipartisan support for Taiwan within the US Congress, the US will likely continue to provide arms shipments to Taiwan as specified under its Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), much like as was seen during Trump’s first term in office. Similarly, with the Philippines, the US will diplomatically oppose mainland Chinese claims in the South China Sea, but is likely to be reluctant militarily to support Philippine claims in outlying islets in the South China Sea through strict adherence of the US- Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. As such, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will be more circumspect in enforcing claims to maritime features that the Philippines does not already control. While the Biden administration positioned Japan as the central node of its “pivot to Asia policy,” this positioning will probably be weaker under Trump, with higher tariffs on Japanese imports and more requirements for Japan to mirror US policy on restricting mainland Chinese access to “leading edge” technologies such as in semiconductors and artificial intelligence. Japan’s current Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government along with several prominent opposition parties has signaled support for increasing Japan’s strategic autonomy from the US, which would be more likely under the incoming Trump administration. As in Japan, Trump would expect Australia to support US tariffs on mainland China, but Australia would be hesitant to take such action, or at least not to do so fully matching US actions, since it has recently negotiated resumption of agricultural and commodities trade with mainland China. Trump’s support for AUKUS will continue. India will likely maintain a trade surplus with the US that Trump will seek to narrow with tariffs on Indian imports in metals, agriculture, textiles and pharmaceuticals. Additional restrictions on worker visas for Indian IT professionals are also likely. India will likely impose retaliatory tariffs on US auto and medical equipment, but this will not significantly impact US investment in India and their security cooperation. The North Korean government is very likely to be receptive to potential negotiations initiated by the Trump administration focused on receiving formal approval of its nuclear status, removing some US-led trade sanctions and facilitating in-person diplomatic engagement.

slowdown. Export volumes from Asia-Pacific economies, particularly mainland China, would grow more slowly or decline as higher tariffs would lead to lower demand from the US. While the extent and timing of tariff increases under the Trump administration are unclear, mainland China is likely to be subjected to higher increases in tariffs than other economies as soon as the first quarter of 2025. Mainland China will likely rely on further fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact of weaker external demand, and to lower import tariffs on regions other than the US, while seeking to expand its trade by seeking more bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs). The overall impact on mainland China’s trade will also depend on whether any trade redirection away from the US would lead to any other markets to also impose tariffs on select mainland Chinese goods to protect their domestic market, and how much global economic growth and demand would be impacted by the US’ proposed universal tariffs on other economies. The imposition of tariffs will also likely encourage more reshoring and a shift in sourcing to geographies with an FTA with the US. Aside from mainland China, universal tariffs would have significant direct trade and wider economic effects for Vietnam, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Japan and the Philippines, as merchandise exports to the US account for over 15% of their respective total merchandise exports. Prior to US implementation of tariff increases, frontloading of export orders — already seen in some products like steel shipments from mainland China in recent months — is likely, but at the expense of future demand. The shift toward greater protectionism is also likely to accelerate front-loaded mainland Chinese demand for Japan’s semiconductor production machinery.  In addition, a slowdown in mainland China’s economy would impact exports from Hong Kong SAR, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea because of the high share of exports to mainland China in their total exports. Asia-Pacific economies appear better prepared than during 2018–21 to respond to US tariff increases by new investment policies and counter-imposing tariffs on US goods; the scope of countermeasures would be limited. Given the much smaller amount of goods purchased by mainland China from the US, it is unlikely to retaliate with equal magnitude. Trade impacts are likely to be mitigated by prior supply chain adjustments: the mainland China-US trade surplus declined by 37% between 2018 and 2023. Other Asia-Pacific economies are likely to respond by raising tariffs on US products, but their scope for retaliation is constrained by widespread positive trade balances with the US. Many Asian countries are also likely increase efforts to protect their domestic markets from mainland Chinese goods potentially being diverted from the US market. US-allied countries and those within the Indo-Pacific Framework for Prosperity are likely to respond less strongly to US tariffs. Asia-Pacific currencies are likely to depreciate due to tighter global financial conditions and dollar strength worsening their inflation outlook. Higher tariffs would raise consumer price inflation in the US by increasing import prices for consumer goods and materials (with higher input costs likely to be passed on to consumers). More broadly, renewed US inflation is likely to encourage more restrictive US monetary policy, higher US treasury yields and tighter global financial conditions. A boost to US inflation is likely to put the US Fed’s easing cycle on hold. Wider interest rate spreads for emerging market securities and financial market volatility would weaken Asia-Pacific currencies compared with S&P Global Market Intelligence’s October baseline forecast. Some Asia-Pacific central 

banks including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas have already started their monetary easing cycles prior to the US Fed’s rate cut in September. We previously expected other important central banks in the region, including the Reserve Bank of India, to follow in cutting rates before end-2024, as forecast in our October forecast release (see Asia-Pacific: Sept. 26, 2024: US Fed’s rate cut creates more scope for monetary policy easing across Asia-Pacific region, but response will be nuanced ). A tighter US monetary policy stance, weaker local currencies and the resulting increase in domestic inflation combine to indicate that Asian central banks are now likely to delay monetary easing until later into 2025 or to retain current policy rate levels. In some countries like Indonesia and Pakistan, a stronger dollar could drive policy rate increases to stem capital flight and control inflation. In Japan, persistent inflationary pressures coupled with a weaker-than-expected yen could encourage the Bank of Japan to lift its policy rate earlier than in our prior baseline scenario. This is likely to depend on the resilience of domestic activity and the magnitude of the inflationary increase caused by currency depreciation. Inflationary pressures in Japan could be mitigated by lower prices for products imported from mainland China, if it redirects exports previously targeted to the US, although this would increase competitive price pressure for domestic manufacturers where their products compete with mainland Chinese suppliers in either domestic or external markets. The Asia-Pacific economies also face negative fiscal impacts from higher borrowing costs, if US interest rates stay higher for longer, and if fiscal stimulus measures are introduced to offset flagging aggregate demand (including the impact of reduced exports). Retaliatory tariffs are unlikely to generate substantial revenues and would likely be passed on to consumers. As a result, progress on fiscal consolidation, initiated by many Asia-Pacific governments following the pandemic-related deterioration in their fiscal balances, would slow, contributing to higher fiscal deficits and higher public debt trajectories over time. This is particularly the case in mainland China, where central government borrowing expansion is the main policy response to counteract weakness in private-sector demand, property sector weakness and persistent fiscal stress at the local level. Further expansionary measures are likely if mainland Chinese exports are curtailed by new tariffs. Tight financial conditions could also further destabilize the fragile South Asian economies of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, increasing default risk in Pakistan and hindering emergence from default in Sri Lanka. Acceleration of supply chain realignment Realignment of global supply chains, primarily in response to Trump’s tariff increases on mainland China, is likely to intensify. More high-tech companies from South Korea and Taiwan will likely rapidly divest from mainland China to protect their businesses from risk escalation resulting from the US-mainland China strategic competition. Higher protectionism, alongside tax incentives, could also accelerate reshoring Japanese auto production (particularly for electric vehicles) to the US. Asia-Pacific countries which have sought to benefit from supply chain diversification from mainland China — including Vietnam, Malaysia, India and Bangladesh — are likely to find fewer avenues for future trade diversification, if Trump follows an America First approach to bolster US manufacturing. Accelerated reshoring will likely exacerbate the slowdown in mainland China’s already-declining foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, a trend further compounded by domestic policy uncertainty. As 

mainland China is among the largest FDI sources for many of the Asia-Pacific countries including Indonesia and Vietnam, a further slowdown in the mainland Chinese economy threatens to slow economic growth from the levels contained in our previous forecast. Apart from reshoring, FDI inflows to other Asia-Pacific economies could also weaken, with their weakening currencies discouraging near-term investment, while reduced export growth would dampen domestic investment.
