### Big Picture 2025: Dealing with consequences 

 In new research with our colleagues from across S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Global Sustainable1, we find that supply chains face familiar challenges ranging from geopolitical rivalries and protectionism to climate change and the imperative to build resilience and agility while controlling costs. Key findings If 2024 was the year of elections, 2025 stands to be the year of policy implementation. Protectionism looks set to remain on the agenda in the US and EU, while mainland China’s reaction to those measures may become more active. Mainland China is joining the EU in widening its carbon emissions compliance markets in 2025, providing economic incentives to tackle climate change. Companies can manage geographic risk resulting from policy and climate change by diversifying origins in the long term, spending on technology to build agility in the midterm, and sourcing goods or services from multiple suppliers instead of one, also known as multi- sourcing, in the short term. Spending on automation can be easily wasted, particularly in AI, logistics investments will prove controversial in 2025 in the US ports sector — watch out for a new strike — and additive manufacturing could change the shape of economic development. This report includes contributions from across S&P Global Market Intelligence including Mark Fontecchio (451 Research) and Turloch Mooney (Port Intelligence & Analytics) as well as S&P Global Sustainable1 (Rick Lord, Kuntal Singh).
