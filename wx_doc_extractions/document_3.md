(anonymous)# Three speeds, one big hurdle: Q3 2024 semiconductor supply chain outlook 

## Abstract: 

The semiconductor sector is experiencing varied recovery rates across different segments, with AI applications and Nvidia Corp. driving the fastest growth. Supply chain challenges persist, especially for new AI-related products, complicating the steady rollout of upgrades in both the chip and server segments. Sector revenue growth is expected to slow from 44% in the first quarter of 2024 to 24% in the same period of 2025. The prospects for consumer devices are mixed. The global smartphone market is seeing a temporary growth in shipments due to pent-up demand, but long-term trends indicate a decline due to market saturation. Personal computer shipments are entering a new upgrade cycle, driven by AI-enabled machines. Connected devices like streaming media and video game consoles are experiencing slower growth due to market maturity and lack of new product launches. The industrial equipment and automotive sectors are lagging in chip demand, despite a recent uptick in manufacturing new orders. Industrial chipmakers remain cautious due to high interest rates and inventory challenges, with firms downgrading revenue forecasts amid weak demand and geopolitical uncertainties. International trade volumes of chips are increasing, with growth of 11.0% year over year in the three months to May 31, 2024, while memory chipmakers lead growth due to the requirements of AI applications. Despite weak export data for Taiwan, TSMC and other firms like Samsung and Micron are expanding. The sector will also be aided by the funds recently provided from the US CHIPS and Science Act. The hurdle to recovery comes from export controls related to national security, particularly by the US and EU, which impact semiconductor supply chains connected to mainland China who are advancing their domestic chip production capabilities. Despite funding and progress, mainland Chinese chipmakers face challenges like poor production yields, while the US, Japan and the EU consider further restrictions. These controls may affect chipmakers' revenues significantly, as 30% of their sales come from mainland China.

These controls may affect chipmakers' revenues significantly, as 30% of their sales come from mainland China. AI, real demand: AI the fastest growing chip segment Semiconductors lie at the heart of most manufactured goods’ supply chains, so tracking their performance can provide useful insights into industry more broadly (see: “ More than AI, part 1: Semiconductor supply chain structures in 2024 and beyond ”). This report uses a mixture of international trade, financial and purchasing manager survey data to identify key trends in the sector including disparate growth rates and regulatory hurdles. Our latest quarterly reading indicates that, heading into the second half of 2024, most segments are in recovery, but at markedly different rates between AI applications, consumer devices and industrial products including autos. AI applications for graphics processors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) have meant processors have been the fastest growing segment of the sector. The consensus of financial analysts’ forecasts shows revenues of the top 10 chip producers rose by 44% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, with growth expected to slow to 24% by the first quarter of 2025. The processor segment grew fastest in the first quarter of 2024 at 82%, led by revenues of Nvidia Corp. While growth is expected to slow to 31% in the first quarter of 2025 that is still significantly faster than memory chips’ growth of 19% and communications chips’ 14%. Nvidia Corp.’s reported revenue grew 262.1% year over year on the back of surging demand for AI use cases and applications. Nvidia provides chips that are optimized for vector math that machine learning companies use to train models and infer new data. The company noted that it is supply-constrained, saying, “Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.” The company's inventory-to-sales ratio fell by 64.9% year over year, reflecting only a modest rise in inventories against the large increase in sales. The company is nonetheless expected to increase its sales by 38% in first quarter 2025 versus first quarter 2024, resulting in an additional $9.83 billion or revenues compared with the total of the other top 10, which will add $9.7 billion. The disparity shows the extent to which the fortunes of semiconductor supply chains are being flattered by the AI boom. As has been the case for processors in the past, AI systems are moving into an annual cycle of upgrades, with Nvidia announcing its Blackwell Ultra system for 2025 and Rubin in 2026, while Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD) will deliver the MI325X earlier than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a new range of chips in 2025 and 2026. Rolling out steady upgrades may therefore be more complex from a supply chain perspective than the historical delivery of upgrades to single chips only, underlining the importance of integrated manufacturing (see “ More than AI, part 1: Semiconductor supply chain structures in 2024 and beyond ”). Supply chain challenges 

are an issue for wider AI-related products. Server producer Super Micro Computer Inc. has stated its production “continues to face some supply chain challenge due to new products that require new key components.” The firm nonetheless “expects strong growth in the fourth quarter as the supply chain continues to improve with new air-cooled and liquid-cooled customer design wins.” Upgrade cycle: Consumer and business devices End-user devices including smartphones, PCs and connected devices such as streaming media and videogame consoles are also moving at a variety of speeds, reflecting disparate upgrade cycles and new product releases. The new outlook for global smartphone shipments from S&P; Global Market Intelligence shows a temporary return to growth in deliveries (see “ Global smartphone forecast through 2028: Fewer new users, fewer replacements ”). Pent-up demand that has been building over the past two years during smartphone shipment declines may be enough to reverse the downward trend temporarily, but the larger influence of lengthening replacement cycles and the shrinking pool of those yet to own a smartphone will hold back unit shipments in the long run. Deliveries are expected to jump by 10.4% in 2024 from the 2023 low, though that’s dependent in part on new product releases focused on AI applications enticing buyers back. Looking further ahead, annual smartphone shipments are forecast to continue declining to 1.08 billion units by 2028 at a -0.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 as the market ceiling lowers with every year the world moves inexorably closer toward total saturation. Similarly, the signs of maturity for the smartphone installed base — including saturation and shrinking new customer pools — are expected to stymie further expansion, slowing it to a 1.3% CAGR from 2023 through 2028; this is less than half the 2.9% CAGR from 2018 to 2023. Shipments of personal computers are also expected by manufacturers to enter a new upgrade cycle as machines delivered in 2020 and 2021 reach their replacement age, aided by offerings of AI-enabled machines. Nvidia has announced that PC makers ASUSTeK Computer Inc. and MSI Computer Corp. will use the chipmaker’s GeForce RTX for AI tasks in their new range of computers. Similarly, AMD has announced its Ryzen AI chips will be used by HP Inc. and Lenovo Group Ltd., among others. Computer and printer maker HP Inc. reported a 3% year-over-year increase, the first improvement since the same quarter of 2022. The firm expects further growth in the next six months as “AI-enabled” PCs enter the market, accounting for 10% of sales in the current fiscal year and 50% by 2026. While the outlook for commercial systems from the firm is positive, it is “cautious on the demand side on consumer” in the remainder of 2024. Dell Technologies Inc. reported 3% year-over-year growth in sales of commercial PCs, while its consumer sales were unchanged. For the rest of the year, outside AI, the firm sees “stabilization with improvement” in market conditions. Peripherals producer Logitech International S.A. expects to be an indirect beneficiary “as you see that PC refresh cycle happening with AI chips going more local in machine, we think we will have an attach rate that will be a tailwind to us over time as you see a large PC refresh happening.” There are signs the laptop makers are starting to ramp up imports to the US, albeit during the normal off-peak season. US seaborne imports of laptops linked to Lenovo and HP increased by 110% year over year and 36% year over year, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024, Market Intelligence data shows. Not all firms are expanding though, with shipments linked to Dell Technologies Inc. and MSI Computer Corp . falling by 12% and 19% respectively. Among other connected devices the recent progress is somewhat slower, reflecting market maturity and an absence of new product launches. Global shipments of streaming media devices (such as Alphabet Inc.’s Chromecast and 

Amazon.com Inc.’s Fire) fell by 6.5% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, according to Market Intelligence analysis. That represents the 11th straight quarterly decline and was led by a drop of 15.3% in shipments of Apple Inc.’s TV system. Global shipments of video game consoles fell by 32.3% year over year in the off-peak first quarter of 2024, Market Intelligence data shows. The absence of new systems is expected to lead to further declines in the rest of the year, alongside high prices and a lack of major new software series. Sony Group Corp. placed incentives on sales of its PlayStation 5 consoles for two weeks through June 12, including over 10% off the purchase price as well as bundled services, according to reports. That may be designed to spark a round of upgrades from prior systems. This follows a cut in sales forecasts from the firm in February (see “ Supply Chain Edge: Red Sea meets Black Friday, cars impounded, PlayStation cut ”). International trade data backs up the thesis of a multispeed recovery. Market Intelligence data for exports of smartphones from early reporters (mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore) rose in May by 7.9% year over year after a 9.1% dip in the first quarter. As noted already, shipments of laptop computers are not growing universally, possibly due to the seasonality of purchases, which are weighted to the second half of the year, with exports in May falling by 4.3%. Other devices fell, including a 0.6% dip in network-connected devices and a 53.8% slump in videogame console shipments in May. At the aggregate, the total value of exports of semiconductor-using consumer goods fell by 0.6% as the growth in phones was offset by other devices. While new consumer products may be a boon for the chip sector, one challenge comes from seasonality (i.e. peak deliveries within a two-month period) given risks to disruptions in the shipping industry (see “ There may be trouble ahead: Q3 2024 supply chain outlook ”). At least at start of May, there was little sign of early or abnormal shipping in exports of consumer electronics from early reporters, with May shipments following a similar trend to prior years and the already-noted minor gain on a year-over-year basis. Struggling for traction: Industrials and autos slower growth sectors The industrial equipment and automotive sectors have lagged other chip-using supply chains, though the S&P; Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ New Orders Index showed growth in May 2024 for the first time since March 2023. The index recovery was also rapid, reaching 50.7 (over 50 indicates sequential growth) from 46.4 in April. Industrial equipment has historically lagged other electronic equipment sectors, reflecting capital expenditures typically rise later in the economic cycle than for other goods, as well as a pause in the upgrade cycle for corporations, potentially exacerbated by higher interest rates. Many of the industrial chipmakers still have a bearish outlook due to challenges to industrial capex from higher interest rates as well as inventories of chips that are proving difficult to clear. Industrial chip producer Infineon Technologies AG has launched a cost-cutting program in response to continued weak demand expectations, according to press reports. The firm downgraded its revenue decline forecast for 2024 to a 13% year-over-year drop from the 8% 

previously stated. Diversified chip fabricator GlobalFoundries Inc. has cited a 15.9% year-over-year drop in first-quarter revenue due to “the combination of elevated inventory levels and the uncertain demand environment,” and noted that it expects “macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties to persist through 2024.” Texas Instruments Inc. reported first-quarter revenues down 16.4% year over year, while inventories increased by 24.2%. The company noted that this increase was in part as “as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels” — leaving supplies stuck in upstream — but that the company feels that the benefits of a ‘just in case’ reserve are “much higher than the downside risk.” ON Semiconductor Corporation reported an 8% decline in automotive and industrial chip revenues in the fiscal third quarter “amid continued inventory digestion” by customers. The firm is “seeing early signs of stabilization” in industrial chip demand, but nonetheless expects “softness across all end markets” during the second quarter of 2024. Aside from industry equipment, there have been specific challenges for chip suppliers linked to the slowdown in electric vehicle demand growth. Diversified chip producer Jabil Inc. has warned that its faces “softened demand” due to “overcapacity” in the mainland Chinese EV space, as well as in renewable energy and capital equipment sectors, with the recovery remaining “uncertain.” NXP Semiconductors N.V. expects “continued inventory digestion process with our major direct Automotive Tier 1 customers.” Industrial “internet of things” products are expected to see growth in mainland China while sales are seen as weaker in Europe. The firm also expects to maintain inventories at around 1.7 months versus a prior long-term target of 2.5 months. Lattice Semiconductor Corporation stated revenues in its Industrial and Automotive segment was down by 25% sequentially “as demand softened and end customers reduced their inventory levels.” STMicroelectronics N.V. cut its forecast for revenues in 2024 by 6% ($14 billion to $15 billion from $15.9 billion to $16.9 billion previously) as “automotive semiconductor demand slowed down compared to our expectations, entering a deceleration phase.” Chip fabricators and suppliers feeling better overall Most of the semiconductor firms mentioned so far don’t make their own chips, rather relying on fabricators (fabs) to physically produce the chips, making physical trade in computer chips a useful guide to sector performance. There’s been a growing resurgence in the international trade volumes of chips, with growth numbers flattered by depth of downturn particularly in memory chips. Exports from South Korea in three months to May 31, 2024, Market Intelligence data shows, moving back to their September 2022 level after growth of 47.7% year over year. Shipments from mainland China similarly climbed by 18.5% to reach their July 2022 high. There was a notably slower development from Japanese exporters with growth of just 3.9% in dollar terms as trade is roiled by the weakness of the yen. Even more notably, exports from Taiwan dropped by 12.3% despite being the home of the AI chip boom courtesy of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. Taking the four export centers together, the dollar value of chips shipped in the three months to May 31, 2024 rose by 11.0% year over year, suggesting the industry at the aggregate is well into its recovery phase. The memory chip-makers have led the way in growth terms thanks to the dual trends of recovery from a sharp downturn combined with new AI applications. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.’s semiconductor division has reported revenue growth of 68% year over year, including a 96% expansion in memory helped by High Bandwidth Memory used in AI applications. For the year, the firm expects “strong demand for PC/mobile thanks to the expansion of on-device AI,” which should come “despite volatility related to macro trends, geopolitical trends etc.” Memory chip producer Micron Technology Inc. reported 82% year-over-year growth in revenue thanks to price increases of 20% sequentially in both DRAM and NAND segments, which were the result of “industry supply-demand conditions (which) continued to improve.” That was largely due to AI-related sales with “only steady near-term demand in PCs and smartphones.” SK Hynix Inc. posted revenue growth of 144% year over year and flagged a recovery in demand across the board, led by AI-related high-bandwidth memory, which also led the firm to increase its capex plans. Despite weak export data for Taiwan, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) reported 15.3% year-over-year growth in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 and has a 

midpoint guidance for a 20% expansion in the second quarter. The firm expects “the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to experience a more mild and gradual recovery in 2024” in part due to slow consumer demand linked to the economy. The latter has led TSMC to cut its forecast for semiconductor industry growth to “approximately 10%” year over year in 2024 from “more than 10%” previously. Notably, the firm expects AI processors to account for 20% of revenue by 2028. Manufacturing equipment suppliers to the main chipmakers expect an upturn across the board after a downturn in demand for equipment recently. ASML Holding NV has stated that “the second half of 2024 is expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry’s continued recovery from the downturn.” The firm cites as evidence of the recovery in chip demand that “customers are first driving up the utilization of their tools.” That followed a 61% slump in new equipment orders in the first quarter of 2024 versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Tokyo Electron Ltd. expects a slow recovery in the semiconductor sector, noting “investment for leading-edge DRAM will start to recover from late 2024,” including products for AI, where the firm sees annual growth of 31%. In 2025, the firm notes “a full-fledged recovery in capital investment is also expected,” including AI chips in PCs and phones and driven by consumers choosing to “replace those products purchased during the pandemic.” Looking at chip pricing, the weak demand and improving supply conditions will allow price escalation rates for semiconductors and components to return closer to the long-run average over the second half of 2024 and into 2025, Market Intelligence analysis finds (see: “ Pricing Analysis - Semiconductors “). Over the remainder of 2024, sourcing components used in computers, automobiles and servers turns more favorable with the looser supply/demand balance shifting leverage away from sellers. Lead times will recede and input costs have improved, but prices remain elevated. Conditions for buyers will generally improve over the next year as semiconductor producer prices fall. The past three months have also brought a bounty of funding for the sector’s longer-term capex plans from the US CHIPS and Science Act. TSMC received $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans. Those will help finance $65 billion of investment across three plants, up from $40 billion for two. The first two plants are due to come online in 2025 and 2028 with the third due in 2030. Notably, the new funds include $50 million for staff training in Arizona to address prior issues around the availability of skilled labor. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. will receive up to $6.4 billion of grants and loans, according to the Department of Commerce, against $40 billion of anticipated investment on sites in Austin and Taylor, Texas. The plant will produce packaged chips — including processors and memory in a single structure — as well as using a hub approach. That addresses one of the concerns that US semiconductor supply chains would still have to send completed chips to other countries for packaging. Previously, Intel Corp. received a grant of up to $8.5 billion against a planned $100 billion in investment over five years. The company also plans to utilize investment tax credits for sites in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. The US government has assigned $6.14 billion in grants and loans to Micron Technology Inc. to support investment in three DRAM (memory) chip fabricating plants. The plants will produce basic DRAM as well as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI applications. Altogether those awards bring the total allocated under the CHIPS for America Act to $29.3 billion across seven firms since December and is critical to US plans to develop semiconductor independence (see “ More than AI, part 2: Semiconductor supply chain political and physical challenges in 2024 and beyond ”). While the plants may confer security, that may come at a cost. TSMC has stated that if a customer “requests to be in some certain 

area … we expect our customers to share some of the higher cost with us.” The hurdle: Policy and regulatory uncertainty A fly in the recovery ointment has been the continued spread of export controls linked to national security policies particularly in the US and EU, focusing on supply chains connected to mainland China. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) are reported to have outlined patents that indicate they may have a domestically developed technique for producing 3-nanometer (nm) node chips, the current most sophisticated in-production chip at TSMC. Mainland China’s chipmakers also have additional funding available, with the government having completed a $47 billion funding round for its National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Phase III (also known as the “Big Fund”), according to reports. Funding is reported to be dedicated to reducing industry chokepoints. The emergence of domestically produced AI chips in mainland China can also be seen in reduced achieved prices for systems, according to Nvidia Corp. Manufacturing success if far from guaranteed, with reports of poor production yields and quality for SMIC’s output for Huawei. The move toward mainland Chinese independence in semiconductors is apparent from exports of chips outperforming imports over the past five years. Market Intelligence data shows exports were up by 20% year over year versus imports, which rose by 20% in the five months to May 31, 2024. Even during the 2023 downturn, exports fell by 11% versus imports 16%. The value of exports has risen to 42.7% of imports in the first five months of 2024 versus 33.2% in 2019. Increased Chinese success may be drawing further regulatory restrictions from the US, Japan and others. The US government is reported to have extended its investigation into Applied Materials Inc.’s sales to customers in mainland China. The firm’s products may be covered by US export restrictions covering semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The firm has noted it is “cooperating fully with the government in these matters.” The US is also reported to be removing the remaining semiconductor export licenses from suppliers to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and these include products supplied by Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. The latter move likely reflects Huawei’s latest phone developments, which have reportedly used 7-nanometer production technology that the US had previously sought to restrict, as well as the new patent flagged above. The new rules may also restrict Huawei’s production of the new Matebook X Pro laptop, which was launched in early May. The firm has nonetheless started to displace foreign components in its newest phones, with reports indicating that the memory chip in its Pura 70 phone is from an in-house chip manufacturer rather than SK Hynix Inc., whose chip was reportedly used in prior devices. Future US restrictions will in part be a function of the results of the US presidential elections in November (see: “ There may be trouble ahead: Q3 2024 supply chain outlook ”). Direct US restrictions may have limited utility given they already accounted for just 18.0% of mainland China’s imports of semiconductor equipment in the 12 months to April 30, 2024, while mainland China was 11.3% of US exports according to Market Intelligence data. Export restrictions are a much bigger issue with regard to supplies from Japan (27.2% of mainland China imports with mainland China being 45.4% of Japan exports) and the EU (25.9% of mainland China imports while mainland China is 40.4% of EU exports). Despite the higher exposure, the Japanese government is limiting exports of technology products as part of a new rolling-basis approach (see “ Wider scan, narrow focus: Japan’s proposed technology export limits ”). The Japanese government is proposing a new set of technology export restrictions, including on quantum computing and semiconductor manufacturing. Those rules may be updated on a rolling basis and could draw retaliation from 

counterparties that experience restrictions. In mainland China the restrictions are having a limited impact on overall imports of semiconductor equipment, which rose by 64% year over year in the three months to May 31, 2024. That reflects the development of mature node technologies, which are typically not covered by export restrictions, though a 16.9% drop from the peak reached in the three months to Nov. 30 may indicate that the wave has crested. The restrictions are not all working in one direction. Mainland China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued rules requiring local telecom operators to stop using processors produced by US firms in core networks by 2027, according to reports. Chinese firms are also reported to be looking at adapting their machines to the new rules, utilizing mixed models of GPUs to deal with shortages of key components. The widening trade restrictions on computer chips and manufacturing technology may have a measurable effect on the chipmakers’ revenues. The firms can ill-afford to lose access to the mainland China market given 30% of revenues come from mainland China versus 25% from the US. Expect to get more feedback in the forthcoming earnings call season. Qualcomm Incorporated has noted that it has already planned to phase out sales of certain chips to mainland China during 2024, but it has brought that date to May rather than December, though that does not require “changing our financial guidance” according to the phone chip company. Nvidia has already flagged that its operations in mainland China were impacted by US export controls, which make Nvidia chips less competitive in the territory. The firm noted that “Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October.”
